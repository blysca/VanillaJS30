    // You might think we can just do something like this:
	team[3] = 'lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
	const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way
	const team5 = Array.from(players)
	console.log(team5)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
	const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
	const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
	team4[2] = 'bububu';
	console.log(players)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
	
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
//	const per2 = person;
//	console.log(per2, person);
//	per2.number = 99;
//	console.log(per2, person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
	const per3 = Object.assign({}, person, {weight: 90})
	console.log(per3, person);	
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
	const per4 = {...person}
	console.log(per4, person);	
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
